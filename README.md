### Technical Specifications
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: JavaFX for GUI
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Extensive use of OOP principles for modular and maintainable code

## Project Details
- **Group Size**: 5
- **Due Date**: 21st of April 2023

## Game Description
Built using Java and JavaFX, this project aims to recreate the classic arcade game, Asteroids. It involves a space ship navigating through a field of various types of asteroids while avoiding or combating occasional alien ships. The game employs Java's OOP capabilities for a modular and scalable codebase.

### Types of Asteroids
- **Large**: These asteroids move slowly and are easier to shoot. When destroyed, they spawn two medium-sized asteroids.
- **Medium**: These move faster than the large asteroids and spawn two smaller ones upon destruction.
- **Small**: The fastest and smallest asteroids that don't spawn any new ones when destroyed.

### Alien Ships
Alien ships make periodic appearances, shooting at the player. Players can choose to dodge the bullets or try to destroy the alien ships.

### Player's Actions
- **Rotate Right**: Rotates the ship clockwise
- **Rotate Left**: Rotates the ship anti-clockwise
- **Fire**: Fires bullets
- **Apply Thrust**: Accelerates the ship in its current direction
- **Hyperspace Jump**: Transports the ship to a random safe location on the screen

### Momentum
The ship's speed and direction are persistent until counteracted by thrust in the opposite direction, showcasing physics-based momentum.

### Levels
The game progresses through levels of increasing difficulty, with more and faster asteroids appearing as the player advances.

## Technical Highlights
- **Java OOP**: Utilized Java's object-oriented programming features for modular design, code reusability, and ease of maintenance.
- **JavaFX**: Used for creating the graphical user interface, making the game visually appealing and interactive.
